## 🚀 To Add These to Firebase

**First, make sure Realtime Database is enabled in Firebase Console!**

Then run:
```bash
npm run seed:firebase
```

This will add all 10 properties to your Firebase Realtime Database.

## ✅ Old File Removed

- ❌ `data/properties.ts` - **DELETED** (no longer needed, using Firebase now)

## 📝 Note

The seed script is ready. Once you enable Realtime Database in Firebase Console, run the seed command and all 10 properties will be added automatically!
